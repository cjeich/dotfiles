Linux configuration files for commandline amazingness

Though my local config is changing all of the time, this is the base config that I copy to all my hosts && virtual hosts
It's a good start to get the commandline up and running the way I like it.

Features:
* oh-my-zsh config
* custom bash prompt with git repository information
* inputrc with reverse history search on arrow up/down
* custom ls highlighting
* common aliases.

Use it if you like it.
